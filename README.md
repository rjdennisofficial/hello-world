Time-honored Hello World Tutorial

Hello! My name is RJ. I have a diploma in Business Programming and Web Devlopement from 2002, but am re-learning and learning new web development skills via Lynda.com, taking the Full-Stack Web Development course. Besides learning, I am currently working on several projects, a couple of which are dedicated to my favorite game, Magic the Gathering. I also had a personal Wordpress blog from 2006-2012, before it got hacked and had malware installed on it. Also, I have created a personal website, as well as a now-defunct website for a local massage therapist. 

Other projects I have going on are adding the Meetup.com API to a website run by the director of one of the Meetups I attend, and soon to be helping a local church redesign their site.
